    "    - In the option, select the \"Treshold\", select a level between [160,2976] and click on \"Use for Masking\".

It´s better to have some surrounding tissue rather than erase some interested areas).\n",

    "    - Use also the filter \"Closing - Fill holes\", this time select an higher kernel (5/6 mm ). To address single spots, under the setting \"Smoothing brush option\", click on Edit in 3D view to paint in 3D view and close the local holes.\n",
