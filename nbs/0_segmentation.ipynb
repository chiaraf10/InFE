    "    - On the upper left, click on DCM, Under section \"Reload & Test\", click on \"Import DICOM files\". Choose the files from the directory. \n",
    "    - On the import DICOM page, under in the \"Series\" option, select the volume to import and click on Examine, then Load. \n",

    "\n",
    "    - Press the lens button (in the upper part of the window) and search for the Module \"Crop Volume\" and Switch to Module.\n",

    "    - In the Input ROI: select \"Create a new ROI\"\n",
    "    - In the Advance section, Tick the \"interpolated cropping\" and \"Isotropic Spacing\".\n",
    "    - Now move around the box in the different views to select only the volume of interest & Apply.\n",
    "    - From now on the ROI markers are of no use. On the Data module, click on the eye button, to make the ROI invisible.  Will make it easy to work with the next steps.\n",

    "    - In the option, select the \"Treshold\", select a level between [160,2976] and click on \"Use for Masking\". (The optimal level is whem the area highlighted is the bone, but not the surrounding tissues. Be careful on not outfilter some of the interested are. It´s better to have some surrounding tissue rather than erase some interested areas).\n",
    "    - Let´s use semi-automatic segmentation. Go to \"Grow from Seeds\" and click on Initialize.\n",
    "    - Go to the brush option and paint on the single slice views, several slices for view. The more time spent in this part, the better the segmentation will be. Make sure to color for both the segments to help the module to differentiate the parts. \n",
    "    - After, go back to \"Grown from Seeds\" and click on Apply. Click on \"Show 3D\" to render the 3D view. \n",
    "    - Toggle the visibility of the \"Other\" segment to assess the segmentation. \n",

    "    - Use also the filter \"Closing - Fill holes\", this time select an higher kernel (5/6 mm ). To address single spots, under the setting \"Smoothing brush option\", click on Edit in 3D view to paint in 3D view and close the local holes.\n",
